This demo showcases two dynamic orbital models for space adventure game developers: an animation-driven model and a physics-driven model. 
Trajectories are efficiently approximated using bezier curves and stored as Curve3D, enabling real-time creation and rendering. 
Stress tests confirm the system can handle 1000+ real-time trajectories effortlessly, even without optimization.
